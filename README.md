   cd antoree-fe-test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

### Build & Preview

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview build locally
npm run preview
```

The build generates a `dist/` folder, and preview runs a local static server.

## ü§ñ AI Recommendations

The AI suggestion system sends POST requests to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`:

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemma-3n-e4b-it",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a JSON-only product recommendation assistant..."
    },
    { "role": "user", "content": "User wants: <prompt>" }
  ],
  "temperature": 0,
  "max_tokens": 80
}
```

**Response**: Array of product IDs `["1","4","9","2"]`

The frontend then fetches detailed product information via `GET /products/:id` and displays results in a carousel/grid.
